# pygemodels
#  Python library for Growth and Epidemiology Models Fitting Routines
### The Need : The main goal here is to estimate the models based on data availability and inferences on statistical tests.

###  Implementation for growth model includes:
1. Logistic Growth Model
2. Generalized Logistic Growth Model
3. Richard Curve
4. Generalized Richard Curve
5. Gompertz Curve
6. Bass Diffusion

###  Implementation for Epidemiology model includes:1. SIR
2. SIS
3. SIRS
4. SEIR
5. SEQIAHR

***These Models can be trained individually or via Interfaces***

### Examples
Growth Models can be trained as:
```python
# growth model examples here
```
Epi Models can be trained as:
```python
# growth model examples here
```
Growth Models Interfaced can be used  as:
```python
# growth model examples here
```
Epi Models Interface can be trained as:
```python
# growth model examples here
```

**Note: This project is under heavy development. Routines can break.
Please use with discretion and caution.**
